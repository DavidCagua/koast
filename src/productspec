## 🎯 Automation Rules Engine

### Complex AND/OR Logic Support
Rules can have multiple condition groups with AND/OR logic:

```
IF (spend > 1000 AND ctr < 0.02) OR (clicks > 500) THEN pause_campaign
IF (reach > 10000 AND frequency > 2) AND (cpc > 1.5) THEN increase_budget
```

### Rule Structure
- **Condition Groups**: Multiple groups connected by OR logic
- **Conditions**: Individual metric comparisons within groups
- **Group Operators**: AND/OR logic within each group
- **Actions**: Mock actions executed when conditions are met

### Available Metrics
- `spend` - Total campaign spend
- `clicks` - Total clicks
- `reach` - Total reach
- `impressions` - Total impressions
- `inline_link_clicks` - Link clicks
- `cost_per_inline_link_click` - Cost per link click
- `frequency` - Ad frequency
- `cpc` - Cost per click
- `ctr` - Click-through rate (from API)

### Available Actions
- `pause_campaign` - Pause the campaign
- `increase_budget` - Increase campaign budget
- `decrease_budget` - Decrease campaign budget
- `send_notification` - Send notification

### Available Operators
- `gt` - Greater than (>)
- `lt` - Less than (<)
- `eq` - Equal to (=)
- `gte` - Greater than or equal (≥)
- `lte` - Less than or equal (≤)

### Group Operators
- `AND` - All conditions in group must be true
- `OR` - Any condition in group can be true
